# 🌌 Rachmat Febrian — Personal Portfolio Website

This is a simple portfolio website that I created as part of my HTML & CSS learning journey.  
I experimented with a **futuristic aesthetic design**, featuring **neon glow**, **glassmorphism**, and an **asymmetrical project layout**.

The website contains 4 main pages:

- 🏠 Home
- 👤 About Me
- 🧱 Projects

This project is simple, but I’m proud of the progress and the futuristic aesthetic style I achieved.  
I will continue learning and improving my front-end development skills.
Thank you for checking out this project!
As a beginner, I'm still learning a lot, so I'll likely continue to update this project from time to time.
