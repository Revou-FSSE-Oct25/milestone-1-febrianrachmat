# 🌌 Rachmat Febrian — Personal Portfolio Website

This is a simple portfolio website that I created as part of my HTML & CSS learning journey.  
I experimented with a **futuristic aesthetic design**, featuring **neon glow**, **glassmorphism**, and an **asymmetrical project layout**.

The website contains 4 main pages:

- 🏠 Home  
- 👤 About Me  
- 🧱 Projects  
- 📩 Contact 

## 🚀 Features

### 🌙 Futuristic Aesthetic Theme
- Neon cyan & purple  
- Soft glowing elements  
- Glassmorphism surfaces  
- Modern typography (Poppins)

### 🧱 Asymmetrical Flexbox Project Layout
- The Projects page uses **Flexbox**  
- Each project card has a different size (tall, wide, small, medium)  
- Futuristic hover glow & floating effect  

### 📱 Fully Responsive
- Mobile-friendly layout  
- Uses flex-wrap and media queries  
- Asymmetrical cards remain visually balanced on smaller screens  

### 🔗 Futuristic Social Footer
- GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram icons  
- Neon hover glow  
- Glassmorphism footer panel
