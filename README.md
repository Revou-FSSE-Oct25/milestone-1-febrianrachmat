- **Projects Section** showcasing my early projects hosted on GitHub Pages and with placeholders for future project details.
- **Contact Section** including a functional form with validation and accessibility labels.
- Clear and semantic HTML structure.

    ## Technologies Used

This project uses AI assistance. I created the framework and basic patterns, then enlisted AI's help with the design and the addition of interesting features and technology, but still for beginners (me).
